They are using zkSTARKs to prove rollup state transitions and will use Bitcoin for data availability. Citrea is being developed by Chainway Labs.",

In the event that this operator is dishonest, verifiers (who are from the federated operator set) can initiate a challenge transaction and dispute the malicious operator's withdrawal transactions.\n\nOperatos in this set front liquidity for user withdrawals and are able to redeem funds used for processed withdawals from the bridge program after a specific time period.\n\nClementime improves the trust assumption of bridge programs from trusting a majority of operators to trusting a single operator."
